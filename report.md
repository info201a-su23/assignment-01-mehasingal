## Data Viz Summary

![FBI Active Shooter Graph](https://resize-v3.pubpub.org/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhc3NldHMucHVicHViLm9yZyIsImtleSI6InczOW0zNXZnLzIxNTg0Mzc2NTc0MTgwLmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTYwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfX19)

The data visualization represents the number of 'active shooter' incidents in the United States annually from 2000-2015 through a traditional bar chart posted by the Washington Post with data taken/sourced from the FBI. It is a very simple visualization that almost makes the data not very impactful or create a cause for concern, as the numbers are quite small, and humans would probably sympathize with the situation more if these numbers were large and graphed in a way that better showed this trend. In the textbook, this graph is actually used for comparison between a more traditional data visualization and one that is more abstract and shows the number of lives  and years they lost as humans to gun violence/active shooters. Both projects share the proposition that gun deaths are a serious threat, but the graph that I chose is significantly less impactful and leaves out a lot of important, human context to those active shooter incidents.

> Unlike the Washington Post bar chart, Periscopic's [author of the other graph] work is framed around an emotion: loss (D'Ignazio & Klein, 2020).


## Data Viz Biography

1. **Who or what institution produced the visualization?**

   The person that produced the visualization was Christopher Ingraham for The Washington Post, with the source of the data coming from the FBI. 

2. **When was it produced?**

   While there is no exact date of production or publication, it can be assumed that the graph was made around or after 2015 as the chart displays data about active shooter situations from 2000 to 2015.

3. **Who is the audience for the visualization?**

   The audience of this visualization would most likely be readers of the Washington Post or readers looking to find information on gun violence deaths/data in an article that the graph was most likely published in. The graph would impact someone who probably is in favor of gun control or concerned with the increasing number of active shooters/mass shooters in the US. 

4. **How might the visualization be interpreted or misinterpreted? What   consequences might this interpretation/misinterpretation have?**

   The graph may be severely misinterpreted as something that is not that impactful or accurate in terms of gun violence and mass shootings because a lot of context, both human and informational, is missing. What constitutes an "active shooter" situation? This graph gives no explanation as to what classifies as being an active shooter situation, as these numbers are statistically quite low for gun violence/shootings in this country, for instance how can there only have been 1 "active shooter" situation in 2001? Due to these low numbers and lack of context to the number of victims or scale of the shooting, one may not think that shootings are serving such a large threat. While there is a general upward trend, why were there so many shootings in 2010, but after that it has remained stable at 20? This is not the best visualiation for the purpose of showing how gun violence is an increasing threat, so perhaps this graph was made to do the opposite, or data collected by the FBI was purposelly visualized in this way to make audiences believe that the threat of gun violence/shootings is not as bad as it really is.

5. **How, if at all, does the data visualization represent power or systems?**

   The data visualization represents the influence of the FBI as being a source for nationwide data, especially for matters of violence/crime, and as mentioned in the textbook, their lack of inclusion for emotions and context that makes the situations appear to be more "real" or "human". The graph does not make a good argument to audiences that gun violence is becoming a threat because there is no connection to the emotions of loss, grief, or tragedy, all things that should be associated with gun violence, but typically has become a highly partisan topic, so it can't be included. The FBI is able to keep its power by staying politically neutral, so they are unable to acknowledge these truths or create graphs that acknowledge anything other than logical statistics.
